Programs solving various algorithmic problems

## How to Compile and Run the Programs
All programs are standard C++ and can be compiled with c++:

c++ is_palindrome.cpp
./a.out

## Program Breakdown

* Demonstrates use of abstract base classes and method overriding.
* Practical Use: Enforcing interface contracts in larger C++ systems
### 2. inheritance.cpp
* Implements class inheritance and method extension for student grading.
* Practical Use: Modeling hierarchical data and extending functionality
### 3/4. exceptional_calculator.cpp / exceptions.cpp
* Showcases exception handling for robust input validation and error reporting.
* Practical Use: Building resilient software, user input validation
### 5. testing.cpp
* Provides modular test cases and assertion-based validation for algorithms.
* Practical Use: Automated testing, debugging, code reliability
